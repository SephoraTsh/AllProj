1. Create data set

USE sql_and_tableau;
-- Create a dataset containing the required columns
CREATE TABLE career_track_completions AS
SELECT
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY cts.student_id, cts.track_id) AS student_track_id,
    cts.student_id,
    cti.track_name,
    cts.date_enrolled,
    CASE WHEN cts.date_completed IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS track_completed,
    DATEDIFF(cts.date_completed, cts.date_enrolled) AS days_for_completion
FROM
    career_track_student_enrollments cts
JOIN
    career_track_info cti ON cts.track_id = cti.track_id;





2. Which career track do students enroll most in? 

SELECT
    track_id,
    COUNT(*) AS enrollments
FROM
    career_track_student_enrollments
GROUP BY
    track_id
ORDER BY
    enrollments DESC
LIMIT 1;




3. What is the career track completion rate? Can you say if itâ€™s increasing,
decreasing, or staying constant with time?


SELECT
    date_enrolled,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_completed IS NOT NULL THEN student_id END) AS completed_students,
    COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) AS total_students,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_completed IS NOT NULL THEN student_id END) / COUNT(DISTINCT student_id) * 100, 2) AS completion_rate
FROM
    career_track_student_enrollments
GROUP BY
    date_enrolled
ORDER BY
    date_enrolled;
    
  


4. How long does it typically take students to complete a career track? What
type of subscription is most suitable for students who aim to complete a
career track: monthly, quarterly, or annual?


SELECT
    cti.track_name,
    AVG(DATEDIFF(cts.date_completed, cts.date_enrolled)) AS average_completion_days
FROM
    career_track_student_enrollments cts
JOIN
    career_track_info cti ON cts.track_id = cti.track_id
WHERE
    cts.date_completed IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    cts.track_id, cti.track_name
ORDER BY
    average_completion_days;
